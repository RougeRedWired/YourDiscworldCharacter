# YourDiscworldCharacter
This is a short project that will be written in Python. Index queries and return closest frequency name.

<h1>Intro:</h1>

Ever heard about Terry Pratchett and his Discworld Chronicles? This project is based upon his universe and awesome world. Bookworm, I read most of the books myself when I was a kid. Fast forwarding to a few weeks back, I was doing at the same time Free Code Camp and Udacity Introduction to Computer Programming ( Which I highly recommend!). 
I am sure that you often see these " Who are you game based on your answers, correct?" Well, while the outcome here is the same, the way to do it is different: 
It gives the closest match to the word you input, here your name ;).
